# Sorting-Visualiser
Hi ,   This is a sorting visualiser created in python with tkinter. 

As the wikipedia says and i quote "_In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order._" 

So basically sorting algorithms are used to arrange the elements in order either ascending or descending, the project visualises the sorting algorithms to give a basic idea about their working. 


The program  (pro1.py) generate bars whose size can be entered by user with random values between range from Min_Value to Max_Value that is  also entered by  the user.Generate button is used for generating the rectangular bars.
